A very basic HTML/CSS Web App Animation Suite

The HTML Files include the code necessary to use the selected animation type

Everything should work as long as the animation-kit.css file is kept within the same folder as the selected animation type html file

Full Screen Animations can be used for many purposes such as having a graphic while fetching data from a server or for running a javascript in the background.
